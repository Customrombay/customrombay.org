Android 14 is the latest version of Googleâ€™s mobile operating system. It was released on October 4, 2023, along with the Pixel 8 series of smartphones. Some of the new features of Android 14 include:
- Ultra HDR mode for improved photo quality
- AI-generated wallpapers
- A monochrome theme for a minimalist look
- Data sharing details for apps to enhance privacy
- Health Connect to sync your health and fitness data
- Larger font sizes and non-linear scaling for better readability
- Facial gesture control for screen accessibility

Android 14 is available for Pixel 4a 5G and above devices, including the Pixel Tablet. Some Android devices from Samsung, iQOO, Nothing, OnePlus, OPPO, Realme, Sharp, Sony, Tecno, vivo, Xiaomi, and other vendors are expected to receive the official update later this year. You can check out more details about Android 14 on the [official website](https://www.android.com/android-14/) or the [developer portal](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14).

## Will my device receive Android 14?
"Will my device receive the next Android version update?" is a question asked by millions of users around the world. Official OTA (over-the-air) updates are already available for Google Pixel 4a (5G) and newer devices from this series, as well as for Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.
When it comes to other manufacturers, it is usually not so straightforward to determine which devices will receive the update and when it will happen. Read the following posts for more information:

If you own a device of another brand, you need to do the research yourself.

## What if my device won't receive the update?
Don't worry! The world is not over (yet). You can continue using your device on an older version of the operating system. It should remain secure for the next couple of years and the app compatibility should not be a problem.

But what if you really want the update? In that case, custom ROMs are probably the only option. Thankfully, Android 14-based custom ROMs start to appear!

## EvolutionX
[EvolutionX](https://evolution-x.org/) is one of the first custom ROMs to adapt Android 14. Their team has already officially updated [Xiaomi Mi 11 (venus)](https://customrombay.org/xiaomi-venus/) and [Poco F1 (beryllium)](https://customrombay.org/xiaomi-beryllium/) with more devices expected to follow. This makes Mi 11 the first device with Android 14 on [customrombay.org](https://customrombay.org/).

## DerpFest
[DerpFest](https://derpfest.org/) is another custom ROM that has adapted Android 14. Nevertheless, the transition does not seem to be complete - some derp-specific components have not been ported to Android 14 yet and some builds are permissive for now. The developers also haven't added their A14 builds to the [updater repository](https://github.com/DerpFest-AOSP/Updater-Stuff), so they have not been included in the [customrombay database](https://github.com/Customrombay/database). The list of devices that have already received the update includes but is not limited to Xiaomi Mi 9T, Redmi Note 9 Pro, Redmi Note 7 Pro, Poco F1, Poco F5, Realme XT, and Motorola G52, G42 and G32.

## Other ROMs
Developers of other custom ROMs have also confirmed that they are working on adapting Android 14. Reignz3, the lead developer of AwakenOS, has posted a [screenshot of Poco F1](https://t.me/AwakenOSChat/63723) running an Android 14-based version of his operating system. The LineageOS team is expected to release their A14 builds at the beginning of next year. The following months will require a lot of work from the developers, so consider supporting them financially.
